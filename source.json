    "p": "To create a professional-looking website, I began by designing a basic HTML, JS, and CSS template. I kept the HTML simple, using divs with specific IDs to make them easily accessible. Next, I created a JSON file to define the structure of the website, including a 'home' page and several other pages. The file looked something like this:",
    "code": "[\n  \"Home\":{\n    \"h1\":\"Welcome\",\n    \"p\":\"This is the homepage of the website.\"\n  },\n  \"Page1\":{\n    \"h1\":\"Page 1\",\n    \"p\":\"This is the first subpage of the website.\"\n  },\n  \"Page2\":{\n    \"h1\":\"Page 2\",\n    \"p\":\"This is the second subpage of the website.\"\n  }\n]",
    "p-1": "Using JavaScript, I created a fetch statement to retrieve the JSON data and render it on the DOM when the page loaded. I then wrote a function to render each value and used a for loop to streamline the process. I did the same for the navbar, using a linear equivalent of the code. I continued to optimize the code, creating separate loops for the content and navbar.",
    "p-2": "To improve the design, I added a background and streamlined the navbar and content container. I also used CSS to incorporate some Bootstrap components into the homepage.",
    "p-3": "Finally, I created cards to display information about the various projects. I began by designing the card in HTML and CSS, then used templates and a JSON file to generate the content dynamically in JavaScript.",
